/**
 * A {@link com.twasyl.slideshowfx.snippet.executor.ISnippetExecutor} requires some configuration which could be defined
 * by the user in a UI. In order to provide a flexible way of define it, this class aims to provide an abstract controller
 * that could be implemented by each implementation of a ISnippetExecutor. This class provides the following useful
 * methods:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #getUI()} which is abstract and must return the UI allowing to configure the snippet executor ;</li>
 *     <li>{@link #getProperties()} which returns the properties that have been defined for the snippet executor ;</li>
 *     <li>{@link #getProperty(String)} which returns the value of a property identified by its name ;</li>
 *     <li>{@link #putProperty(String, Object)} which sets a property identified by its name and value.</li>
 * </ul>
